To add the .eli file into diptrace, add the downloaded .eli file to the Diptrace Lib directory. 

To import this design into a new diptrace schematic, the exported Adj_voltage_reg.asc file can be used with the hierachial block by copy and pasting it 
into the current project. However, another approach can be done by downloading the Adjustable_Voltage_Regulator.dch file and using the hierachial block by copy and pasting into the current project.
