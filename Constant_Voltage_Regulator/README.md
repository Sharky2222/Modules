To add the .eli file into diptrace, add the downloaded .eli file to the Diptrace Lib directory on your computer.

To import this design into a new diptrace schematic, the exported Fixed_voltage_regulator.asc file can be downloaded and used with the hierachial block by copy and pasting it 
into the current project. To generate the export file go to the file and export as a DipTrace Ascii. To import a file, go to the file and import a downloaded .asc file. Another approach can be done by downloading the AConstant_voltage_regulator.dch file and using the hierachial block by copy and pasting into the current project.

This circuit is important in regulating a smooth and constant output voltage wave to ensure applications are getting a consistent source voltage. The ceramic capacitor improves transient response stability.
